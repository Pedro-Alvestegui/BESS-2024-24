# Spatial Analysis Plans
1. 
  a. Purpose
  * My first spatial analysis plan is focusing on finding the distribution of the previous mentioned species throughout the region of Castilla y Leon. On one of our field trips we obtained the data that this species were commonly found in the region, along with the common vole. Therefore, the reason I focused on finding their distribution is to see if they live near the vole as well as to see if there is any possible correlation to where they live with where the common vole lives.

b. Tools & Workflows
* I plan to do the following by following these steps:
    1. Download all CSV files from this following website called GBIF: https://www.gbif.org/
    2. Once it is downloaded, I will extract them from the zip file and put them on a specific folder
    3. All this data will then be put into my virtual QGIS
    4. Now that the data is on the QGIS, I will do a ____
    5. Lastly, since the pointlayer is for all of Spain, to make it just for the Castilla y Leon region I will ___
    6. At the end I will have where are the distributions of the animal species throughout the region
 
c. Expected Outcome
* The expected outcome for this analysis is to
